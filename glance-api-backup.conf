# Secure hashing algorithm used for computing the 'os_hash_value' property.

# when the algorithm is applied to the uploaded or imported image data.
#
# The value must be a valid secure hash algorithm name recognized by the
# python 'hashlib' library.  You can determine what these are by examining
# the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the
# library being used in your Glance installation.  For interoperability
# purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash

# The driver to use for image cache management.
#
# This configuration option provides the flexibility to choose between the
# different image-cache drivers available. An image-cache driver is responsible
# for providing the essential functions of image-cache like write images to/read
# images from cache, track age and usage of cached images, provide a list of
# cached images, fetch size of the cache, queue images for caching and clean up
# the cache, etc.
#
# The essential functions of a driver are defined in the base class
# ``glance.image_cache.drivers.base.Driver``. All image-cache drivers (existing
# and prospective) must implement this interface. Currently available drivers
# are ``sqlite`` and ``xattr``. These drivers primarily differ in the way they
# store the information about cached images:
#
# * The ``sqlite`` driver uses a sqlite database (which sits on every glance
#   node locally) to track the usage of cached images.
# * The ``xattr`` driver uses the extended attributes of files to store this
#   information. It also requires a filesystem that sets ``atime`` on the files
#   when accessed.

# The upper limit on cache size, in bytes, after which the cache-pruner cleans
# up the image cache.
#
# NOTE: This is just a threshold for cache-pruner to act upon. It is NOT a
# hard limit beyond which the image cache would never grow. In fact, depending
# on how often the cache-pruner runs and how quickly the cache fills, the image
# cache can far exceed the size specified here very easily. Hence, care must be
# taken to appropriately schedule the cache-pruner and in setting this limit.
#
# Glance caches an image when it is downloaded. Consequently, the size of the
# image cache grows over time as the number of downloads increases. To keep the
# cache size from becoming unmanageable, it is recommended to run the
# cache-pruner as a periodic task. When the cache pruner is kicked off, it
# compares the current size of image cache and triggers a cleanup if the image
# cache grew beyond the size specified here. After the cleanup, the size of
# cache is less than or equal to size specified here.

# Once an incomplete image spends more time than is specified here, it'll be

# Base directory for image cache.
#
# This is the location where image data is cached and served out of. All cached
# images are stored directly under this directory. This directory also contains
# three subdirectories, namely, ``incomplete``, ``invalid`` and ``queue``.
#
# The ``incomplete`` subdirectory is the staging area for downloading images. An
# image is first downloaded to this directory. When the image download is
# successful it is moved to the base directory. However, if the download fails,
# the partially downloaded image file is moved to the ``invalid`` subdirectory.
#
# The ``queue``subdirectory is used for queuing images for download. This is
# used primarily by the cache-prefetcher, which can be scheduled as a periodic
# task like cache-pruner and cache-cleaner, to cache images ahead of their
# usage.
# Upon receiving the request to cache an image, Glance touches a file in the
# ``queue`` directory with the image id as the file name. The cache-prefetcher,
# when running, polls for the files in ``queue`` directory and starts
# downloading them in the order they were created. When the download is
# successful, the zero-sized file is deleted from the ``queue`` directory.
# If the download fails, the zero-sized file remains and it'll be retried the
# next time cache-prefetcher runs.

#     * Provide the name or the path relative to the glance directory
#       for the paste configuration file and not the absolute path.
#     * The sample paste configuration file shipped with Glance need
#       not be edited in most cases as it comes with ready-made
#       pipelines for all common deployment flavors.
#
# If no value is specified for this option, the ``paste.ini`` file
# with the prefix of the corresponding Glance service's configuration
# file name will be searched for in the known configuration
# directories. (For example, if this option is missing from or has no
# value set in ``glance-api.conf``, the service will look for a file
# named ``glance-api-paste.ini``.) If the paste configuration file is
# not found, the service will not start.
#
# Possible values:
#     * A string value representing the name of the paste configuration
#       file.
#
# Related Options:

# Enable SQL requests profiling in services.
#
# Default value is False (SQL requests won't be traced).
#
# Possible values:
#
# * True: Enables SQL requests profiling. Each SQL query will be part of the
#   trace and can the be analyzed by how much time was spent for that.

# Secret key(s) to use for encrypting context data for performance profiling.
#
# This string value should have the following format: <key1>[,<key2>,...<keyn>],
# where each key is some random string. A user who triggers the profiling via
# the REST API has to set one of these keys in the headers of the REST API call
# to include profiling results of this node for this particular project.
#
# Both "enabled" flag and "hmac_keys" config options should be set to enable
# profiling. Also, to generate correct profiling information across all services

# These store names must be registered with the ``stores``
# configuration option.
#
# NOTE: The ``store_type_preference`` configuration option is applied
# only if ``store_type`` is chosen as a value for the

# Provide a string value representing the executor to use for task
# executions. By default, ``TaskFlow`` executor is used.
#
# ``TaskFlow`` helps make task executions easy, consistent, scalable
# and reliable. It also enables creation of lightweight task objects

#
# Absolute path to the work directory to use for asynchronous
# task operations.
#
# The directory set here will be used to operate over images -
# normally before they are imported in the destination store.
#
# NOTE: When providing a value for ``work_dir``, please make sure
# that enough space is provided for concurrent tasks to run
# efficiently without running out of space.
#
# A rough estimation can be done by multiplying the number of
# ``max_workers`` with an average image size (e.g 500MB). The image
# size estimation should be done based on the average size in your
# deployment. Note that depending on the tasks running you may need
# to multiply this number by some factor depending on what the task
# does. For example, you may want to double the available size if
# image conversion is enabled. All this being said, remember these
# are just estimations and you should do them based on the worst
# case scenario and be prepared to act in case they were wrong.
#
# Possible values:
#     * String value representing the absolute path to the working
#       directory
#
# Related Options:

[taskflow_executor]

#
# From glance.api
#

#
# Set the taskflow engine mode.
#
# Provide a string type value to set the mode in which the taskflow
# engine would schedule tasks to the workers on the hosts. Based on
# this mode, the engine executes tasks either in single or multiple
# threads. The possible values for this configuration option are:
# ``serial`` and ``parallel``. When set to ``serial``, the engine runs
# all the tasks in a single thread which results in serial execution
# of tasks. Setting this to ``parallel`` makes the engine run tasks in
# multiple threads. This results in parallel execution of tasks.
#
# Possible values:
#     * serial
#     * parallel
#
# Related options:
#     * max_workers
#
#  (string value)
# Possible values:
# serial - <No description provided>
# parallel - <No description provided>
#engine_mode = parallel

#
# Set the number of engine executable tasks.
#
# Provide an integer value to limit the number of workers that can be
# instantiated on the hosts. In other words, this number defines the
# number of parallel tasks that can be executed at the same time by
# the taskflow engine. This value can be greater than one when the
# engine mode is set to parallel.
#
# Possible values:
#     * Integer value greater than or equal to 1

#
# Set the desired image conversion format.
#
# Provide a valid image format to which you want images to be
# converted before they are stored for consumption by Glance.
# Appropriate image format conversions are desirable for specific
# storage backends in order to facilitate efficient handling of
# bandwidth and usage of the storage infrastructure.
#
# By default, ``conversion_format`` is not set and must be set
# explicitly in the configuration file.
#
# The allowed values for this option are ``raw``, ``qcow2`` and
# ``vmdk``. The  ``raw`` format is the unstructured disk format and
# should be chosen when RBD or Ceph storage backends are used for
# image storage. ``qcow2`` is supported by the QEMU emulator that
# expands dynamically and supports Copy on Write. The ``vmdk`` is
# another common disk format supported by many common virtual machine
# monitors like VMWare Workstation.
#
# Possible values:
#     * qcow2
#     * raw
